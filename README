Main part of the code used for some of the simulations of the PRE article.

This simulates the dynamics of a 1D lattice with diffusion and advection between totally chaotic elements.

It generates two files; original orbit and shadow orbit. The later is used to calculate the Lyapunov exponent.

Use:

1. Generate the initial conditions with $./ic.sh
2. Compile the main file with $./synch.sh 
3. Run the simulation $./synch alpha epsilon gamma

The output files have data for both orbits after 10E4 time steps transient:
time x1 x2 x3 ... xN average deviation

To go over the whole spectrum for each parameter, I used a cluster PBS computer from Complex System at:
PUC Rio (http://www.puc-rio.br/english/)
